Status Codes. Below are the different categories:

    Informational (1xx): Indicates that the request was received and the process is continuing. It alerts the sender to wait for a final response.
    Successful (2xx): Indicates that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
    Redirection (3xx): Indicates that further action must be taken to complete the request.
    Client Errors (4xx): Indicates that an error occurred during the request processing and it is the client who caused the error.
    Server Errors (5xx): Indicates that an error occurred during request processing but that it was by the server.

=======================================================
Http Status Code: 

1xx - informational response
** 101 - Websocket
---------------------------

2xx - successful response
   200 Successful operation (Post and Update)
** 201 Created (Create)
   202 Request Accepted (Used for ASYNC flow for long running operation and send a temporary API-URL for STATUS check) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4J-eHq_Oms
** 204 No Content (Delete)
---------------------------

3xx - redirection 
   301 Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
** 302 Found and redirect - "Moved temporarily"
    This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. Further changes in the URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests.
   303 See Other - Example Once file updated using ASYNC API's then final response will send download URL using GET reqeust and response status code is 303.
    The server sent this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with a GET request.

   307 Temporary Redirect 
---------------------------

========= 4xx - Client error responses =================
   400	Bad Request (The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax/input)

** 401 Unauthorized (Invalid token or login)  - The client hasn’t authorized itself to the backend yet and the server may give it access after that has happened.
** 403 Forbidden (Permission) - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.

   404	Resource not found (The server can not find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized.)
** 405	Method Not Allowed - Client is calling a URI/Resource/API and API is present on server but that is not allowed for do operation.

** 408 Request Timeout
   409 Conflict - Client is tring to create resource but that is already present in system. Example: Signup a user in a system but user is allready exist in the system we can use HTTP-Status 409 for response.
** 417 Expectation Failed - Client is sending request and server is doing processing and Server side validation comes fail/error then we can use HTTP-Status code 417.

** 429 Too Many Requests (Rate Limiting)
    The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").


========== 5xx - Client error responses ================

    500 Internal Server Error - The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.
	501 Not Implemented - The request method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled.
	502 Bed Gateway (This error response means that the server, while working as a gateway to get a response needed to handle the request, got an invalid response.)
	
**  503 Service Unavailable (The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded)
	504 Getway Timeout (This error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time.)
